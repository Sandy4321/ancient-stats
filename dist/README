Use 

	make ARCH=solaris

or

	make ARCH=sunos

to compile on either solaris or sunos.  If you need to compile on
another architecture, you need to create a new Makefile.new_arch and
then do a 

	make ARCH=new_arch

where new_arch is (of course) the name of the new architecture you
want.  All architecture dependent compilation options should be
specified in this secondary make file.

For the most systems such as Linux, the sunos version should suffice.
