.IX  "analyze contingency tables \(em \fLchi2\fP"
.LP
.B chi2
reads contingency tables from standard input and displays statistics
about these tables on standard output.  The default statistic is
Pearson's \(*x\v'-0.4'\s-32\s0\v'0.4', although a likelihood ratio statistic
known as the G-statistic and mutual information can also be computed.
Significance levels can also be printed.
.PP
For example,
.IP
.B
example% chi2 -lmp 2 2
.LP
causes chi2 to analyze 2x2 tables taken from standard input.  Both
mutual information and the G-statistic are computed and a significance
level (p-value) is given for the value of the G-statistic.
Significance level is meaningless for mutual information, so it is not
printed.  
.LP
The tables can be given in free format and tags consisting of the
remainder of the line after the last entry in the table are echoed on
the output so that results can be easily sorted.  In the example
above, the following input:
.IP
.nf
10 0 0 10 tag1
2 20
5 10 tag2
.LP
would produce the following output:
.IP
.nf
 27.73 0.00000 1.00  tag1
  3.39 0.06544 0.07  tag2
.LP
The first number on each output line is the G-statistic, the second is
the significance level, and the third is the mutual information.  The
remainder of the line contains the associated tag (if any).  The
output lines are always in the order \(*x\v'-0.4'\s-32\s0\v'0.4', then G, and
finally mutual information.  Significance values are printed
immediately after the corresponding statistic.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-l
Use a likelihood ratio test.  This test is also known as the
G-statistic.  For tables where \(*x\v'-0.4'\s-32\s0\v'0.4' is appropriate, the
G-statistic and pearson's \(*x\v'-0.4'\s-32\s0\v'0.4' should give nearly
identical values.  Can be used with -k or -m options.
.TP
.B \-k
If the -k command line option is given, or if neither l, m nor k are
given, then Pearson's \(*x\v'-0.4'\s-32\s0\v'0.4' statistic is used.  if the
expected value in any cell is too small, a warning is printed to standard
error and the value -1 is used instead of the computed value.  The -x
option turns off these warnings and causes the (bogus) value which is
actually computed to be printed instead of -1.  Can be used with -l or
-m options.  If none of -l, -k or -m are used, then -k is implied.
.TP
.B \-m
Compute mutual information for each table.  Can be used with -l or -k
options. 
.TP
.B \-p
Estimate and print significance for the \(*x\v'-0.4'\s-32\s0\v'0.4' or G
statistics if they are printed.  Significance for the
\(*x\v'-0.4'\s-32\s0\v'0.4' and G statistics are computed separately.
.TP
.B \-x
Don't print the error messages for the \(*x\v'-0.4'\s-32\s0\v'0.4' test when
expected value in a cell is too small.  Also, use whatever junk is
computed in these cases instead of substituting -1.
.TP
.B \-b and \-B
These options change the estimators
used to calculate any of selected statistics slightly.  The use of -b
means that all probabilities will be estimated using Laplace's sample
size correction in which (k+1)/(N+m) is used instead of k/N.  With -B,
uniform prior, Bayesian estimators for the statistic in question will
be used.  It isn't clear that \-B makes sense when using the
likelihood ratio test (the G statistic).

.SH NOTES
.LP
The -p option doesn't apply to mutual information.
.LP
The implications of using of -b or -B with -l aren't very clear.
.SH BUGS
.LP
Tables with entirely zero rows or columns can cause problems.
